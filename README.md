# 🚦 PINNs for Traffic State Estimation

A **physics-informed deep learning framework** for traffic state estimation, leveraging macroscopic traffic flow models (**LWR** and **ARZ**) to reconstruct traffic density and velocity from sparse sensor data.

This project implements and evaluates **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** for reconstructing continuous traffic state fields (density and velocity) using the real-world **Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM)** dataset. This is a research paper implementation. To learn more, visit [this website](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9531557).

## 🌟 Project Overview

This system addresses the challenge of **Traffic State Estimation (TSE)** by integrating fundamental traffic flow physics directly into a deep learning model.  
By enforcing the **Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR)** and **Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ)** conservation laws as soft constraints, the model generates **physically consistent and accurate** estimations of traffic dynamics, even with sparse data.

The project provides a complete workflow, from fetching and processing raw NGSIM vehicle trajectory data to training and evaluating PINNs against several baseline models.

## 🔑 Key Capabilities

- **Physics-Informed Traffic State Estimation** – Implements PINNs for both first-order (LWR) and second-order (ARZ) traffic flow models.  
- **Fundamental Diagram Learning** – Includes a `FDLearner` module to learn the complex relationship between traffic density and velocity directly from data.  
- **Comprehensive Model Comparison** – Benchmarks the PINN approach against baseline models: LSTM, Vanilla MLP, and Linear Regression.  
- **Real-World Data Application** – Validates models using the NGSIM dataset in a realistic highway scenario.  
- **End-to-End Data Pipeline** – Includes scripts to fetch, clean, and aggregate traffic data for training.

## 💾 Workflow Description

### 1. Data Processing & Gridding  
**File:** `Notebooks/DataCleaning.ipynb`

- Fetches raw vehicle trajectory data from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s public API.  
- Converts units (e.g., mph → m/s) and standardizes column names.  
- Aggregates data onto a discrete spatio-temporal grid $$\((x, t)\)$$ to compute density $$\(ho\)$$ and velocity $$\(u\)$$.  
- Normalizes the grid and saves the final data as `.csv` files.

---

### 2. Model Development & Training  
**Files:** `Scripts/`, `Notebooks/Exploration.ipynb`

- `pinn_model.py` – Defines the core PINN and FDLearner architectures.  
- `physics.py` – Implements ARZ PDEs and computes physics residuals via `torch.autograd`.  
- `lstm.py` & `vanilla.py` – Baseline architectures.  
- The `Exploration.ipynb` notebook loads the processed data and trains all models (PINN-ARZ, MLP, LSTM, Linear Regression).

---

### 3. Model Evaluation & Comparison  
**File:** `Notebooks/Exploration.ipynb`

- Models are tested on a held-out validation dataset from a different time window.  
- Evaluation metrics: **MSE** and **MAE** for both density and velocity.  
- The **physics residual** is calculated for the PINN model to quantify physical consistency.

$$\ L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{data}} + \lambda_{\text{physics}} \cdot L_{\text{physics}}\ $$

Where:
- $$\ L_{\text{data}}\ $$: Mean Squared Error between predicted and observed data  
- $$\ L_{\text{physics}}\ $$: Mean Squared Error of PDE residuals (physics consistency)
